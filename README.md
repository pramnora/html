## Intro...

HTML, is the main language used to write web pages...; usually, though, HTML is not written/used all on it's own...instead, it is used with: 

- CSS(decorative effects...colours/fonts/positioning)
- Javascript(programming...for web page 'interactivity')

There is quite a lot you can do with HTML itself, though, when it comes to writing plain and simple web pages. For example, HTML includes...

- comments
- metadata
- text
- text effects: b/i/u/strike
- multi-media: drawings/photos/audio/movies
- hr/horizontal rule
- tables
- frames: iFrames
- etc.
